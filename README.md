=============

JasonIsFramed is a RESTful app that reads JSON data from the web and displays it in a tab host fragments.  
The primary purpose for this application is as a tutorial and how to overcome several  implementation gotchaâ€™s;  
1) Using a cursor loader with a tab host, 2) Catching the ListItem OnClick vs a specific item object OnClick.  
The source code is available at https://github.com/pbirdsall/jasonisframed.
